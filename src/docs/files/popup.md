The Popup view in Panda Manager lets you easily manage your pandas without opening the larger Manager view. It consists of three sections: a toolbar, action section, and pandas list. This documentation cover all three sections separately.

## Toolbar

 1. **Manager**
 2. **Settings**

Both buttons open their respective views.

## Actions

 2. **PRE Delay  input**
 	 
 	 This input expects a whole number in milliseconds and represents the delay between every panda's request if a PRE (Page Request Error)  is encountered. The default value is 2000ms.
